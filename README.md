#### Assigment title: Assessing bias and fairness in the income Adult dataset: Study case for Gender and Race 
This project takes as input the Adult dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult), which has already been subject to a classification. Its results represent whether the income of each censed person is higher or lower than 50k$. With this, the aim of this assignment is to assess bias and fairness in this resulting dataset. In this case, on one hand, gender, and on the other hand, race, will be the two taken inputs to assess potential prediction biasses. To do so, the Python library from Aequtias (https://github.com/dssg/aequitas) and Google What-if tool (https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/) are the main instruments used for this analysis (besides other Python libs for data manipulation -see notebook-).
